# cinema4d-posereader

A plugin to extract distinct rotation information per axis.

Extract plugin to your Cinema 4D plugins directory, fire up Cinema 4D and add the "PoseReader" Tag to any object. Drag and Drop the **Origin** and **Target** Objects into the respective fields and select the Axis that should be read. The resulting rotation will be output under the **Result** tab. The rotation will be relative to the **Origin** object regardless of global transformation.
